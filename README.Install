This is release 1.something of fvwm.

fvwm is a relatively small window manager which provides a 3-D look for window
decorations and a virtual desktop. It is reconfigurable in a manner
similar to twm. Most of the Twm functionality has been maintained, with
some new features added.

I would like to know about any bugs that you find.

In this release, there are many optional configuration items. 
Edit configure.h in this directory. Look in the file OS_specifics for settings
that may be required to satisfy your operating system.

Edit the Imakefile in this directory if needed.

You should not need to modify the individual Imakefiles much.
X11R4 users will want to edit fvwm/Imakefile and change
	InstallNonExecFile to InstallNonExec

Untar the fvwm-modules.tar file in this directory. If someone would like to
clean up the build procedure, please do.

Untar the fvwm-icons.tar file in this directory. If someone would like to
clean up the build procedure, please do.

execute the following commands

	xmkmf
	make Makefiles
		(If this command fails or ends in an endless loop,
		 use the shell script MakeMakefiles).
	make all
Monitor the output of the above commands for error messages.

(It is likely that you will need root privilege to write to the
installation directories. If so, become root now)
	make install
	make install.man
Copy fvwm_icons/*.xpm to /usr/include/X11/pixmaps if you want to.
Copy fvwm_icons/*.xbm to /usr/include/X11/bitmaps if you want to.
Copy fvwm_icons/*.bitmap to /usr/include/X11/bitmaps if you want to.
Copy fvwm_icons/*.icon to /usr/include/X11/bitmaps if you want to.


When that's done, you can look at the optional modules in the
optional directory. These will need to be built one by one. These
modules are the ones which I believe may depend on the existence of
software packages or hardware components which may not exist for many
systems.
