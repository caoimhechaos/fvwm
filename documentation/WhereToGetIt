Robert,

	A couple of suggestions:

	1)  Place a file in the fvwm distribution called 'WhereToGet'
	    which tells people that the latested released version
	    is on sunsite and that the latest beta version can be
	    obtained from spcot.sanders.com  -  I think it would
	    cut down on a lot of questions

	2)  A good source of icons is the directory 'AIcons' in
	    the contrib directory of any X archive site, e.g.:

		ftp.x.org: /contrib/AIcons

	    this is collection of the best icons taken from many
	    sources (including the ones you're currently pointing
	    people to).  It also has the advantage of having had
	    the colors reduced to a standard colormap of 30 or
	    so colors, so the icons don't use up the entire color
	    map on a PsuedoColor display
