A kind soul has set up a mailing list for fvwm. Here's the info:


Okay, I set it up...

1. To subscribe:

	mail to Majordomo@wonderland.org with the body of the message:

		subscribe fvwm

	That's all there is to it.  To send to the list, mail to fvwm@wonderland.org.

2. To unsubscribe
	If you are bored with this list, the way to get off of the list is to mail
	Majordomo@wonderland.org a one line message (subject is ignored) saying
	unsubscribe fvwm -- that's it.  If you get an error message, mail me,
	and I'll do it by hand.  

3. There's also fvwm-announce. Just change 'fvwm' in the above instructions to
	'fvwm-announce'.
