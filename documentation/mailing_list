A kind soul has set up a mailing list for fvwm. Here's the info:


Okay, I set it up...

1. To subscribe:

	mail to majordomo@bsdprojects.net with the body of the message:

		subscribe fvwm@lists.bsdprojects.net

	That's all there is to it.  To send to the list, mail to fvwm@lists.bsdprojects.net.

2. To unsubscribe
	If you are bored with this list, the way to get off of the list is to mail
	Majordomo@lists.bsdprojects.net a one line message (subject is ignored)
	saying unsubscribe fvwm@lists.bsdprojects.net -- that's it. If you get
	an error message, mail me, and I'll do it by hand.  

3. There's also fvwm-announce. Just change 'fvwm' in the above instructions to
	'fvwm-announce'.
